				Her name is Sarah; I got to know her yesterday evening.
				<br>
				She reminds me of you.
				<br>
				The way she talks, so enthusiastically, picturing my head of your colors.
				<br>
				I wonder if you are as beautiful as I remember you were.
				<br>
				Or was it just my brain adoring you too much?
			</p>
			<p>
				Softly spoken, spoken words.
				<br>
				I wanna re-hear every word you said to me.
				<br>
				You're obsessed with sex. Scoffed at my obsession with life and breath.
				<br>
				Was it why you left?
			</p>
			<p>
				Was it really why you left?
				<br>
				Oh wait, you never really left, I just never take you back.

			<h1>Rewind,</h1>
			<p>
				Babe, I moved on long time ago.
				<br>
				At least that's how I thought.
				<br>
				Then I saw two friends of yours at that lousy place on Wednesday,
				<br>
				And my chest hurt badly.
				<br>
				I lost my breath.
				<br>
				That made me wonder,
				<br>
				If I ever cross your mind these days.
			</p>
			<p>
				Babe, I asked him about you,
				<br>
				he said he didn't know.
				<br>
				I wonder why did I care to even mentioning your name.
				<br>
				I cried quietly that night thinking of you.
			</p>
			<p>
				Babe, I moved on long time ago.
				<br>
				I really did.
				<br>
				Maybe it was just my chest acting weird, it needs extra time to heal.
				<br>
				Apparently 2,5 years is not enough.
				<br>
				 I should be kind to myself - after all you were my first.
			</p>
			<p>
				Babe, I hope you're doing good,
				<br>
				I hope you're happy with your life.
				<br>
				Too bad we're living so far away.
				<br>
				I wish you the best of everything.

			<p>
				If so much energy needed to perform anger,
				<br>
				Then I would rather spend my energy to perform kindness.
				<br>
				I mean,
				<br>
				The end result is the same.
				<br>
				Opposite, but equally the same.
			</p>
			<p>Oh wait,
			<br>
			Just thinking bout some people I am not looking forward to talk to.
			<br>
			In that case, I will ignore them.
			<br>
			I am good with ignoring people.
			<br>
			Ignoring drama people is actually sparing your energy anyway. Really.

			<h1>Take my turn.</h1>
			<p>
				Been inside for a while.
				<br>
				Collecting shredded pieces of a picture.
				<br>
				Cherry picking thoughts in my brain.
				<br>
				Honey, I think I feel for you.
			</p>
			<p>
				Speak softly slowly.
				<br>
				Tell me all about your life.
				<br>
				All those photographs laying on your bed.
				<br>
				Humming beautiful notes into my ears.
				<br>
				Why haven't I seen you all this time?
			</p>
			<p>
				Take my turn, fall for me.
				<br>
				Honey, I so wish you're mine.

			<p>
				I loved you this much.
				<br>
				That much,
				<br>
				As much as I could love someone.
				<br>
				<br>
				Then you broke me,
				<br>
				As broken as I could be.
				<br>
				But I never blamed you.
				<br>
				You had your own reasons, reasons I will never understand.
				<br>
				And that's ok.
				<br>
				That's really ok, because love was never mentioned.
			</p>
			<p>
				No one ever owns me,
				<br>
				You could, I never told you this.
				<br>
				But you could have.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'd done stupid silly things for you,
				<br>
				You'd done stupid silly things for me,
				<br>
				I guess we're equal.
				<br>
				Equally screwed into each other's bones.
			</p>

			<p>
				Truth is,
				<br>
				I will never forgive you.
				<br>
				Sadly, I love you only.

				He said his name was McLennon,
				<br>
				Like John Lennon.
				<br>
				Couple of times bumping into him.
				<br>
				Cutest boy I have ever seen.
			</p>
			<p>
				Dancing with a lover,

				and another one,

				and another new one.

				I met you before you got a he.
				<br>
				Progressing so fast,

				Making me wanna be you.
				<br>
				I wish I could be you for a second.

			<p>
				Can you take me to downtown with you for once?
				<br>
				Start over, force me tasting random tongues.

				I wanna be an unfaithful heartless slut.

				Call me at seven.

				Can I make you a mission?
				<br>
				My time is ticking, I have got seven months only to hire a her.
				<br>
				Girl, girl, girl, turn it on - cash my money, here is my number and here is my key.
			</p>
			<p>
				Who happens what?
				<br>
				I made stupid comments.
				<br>
				I felt so sad and lonely that morning.
				<br>
				Girl, girl, girl, this is my only chance.
				<br>
				Take my money, just give me back my key.
				<br>
				Will I be seeing you the next morning?
			</p>
			<p>
				Why people testing? why the bad mood ruins a day?
				<br>
				I never asked you to pick, crowd's getting too much to handle.
				<br>
				This is pointless, why are you drying me in the rain?
				<br>
				Listen to me just for once.
				<br>
				All I wanted was to kiss you sweetly.
			</p>
			<p>
				Are we still clicking? You look so pimping, a rigid heart is loving me.
				<br>
				Downtown loving, kissing on the empty street.
				<br>
				Don't worry, I will safe your seat.

				Let's get it on now.

			<p>
				She said:
				<br>
				<span style="background: #fff047; display: inline-block; padding: 0 10px;">I just want a little bit of happiness for you.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				I replied:

				<span style="background: #fff047; display: inline-block; padding: 0 10px;">Thank you,</span>
				<br>
				<span style="background: #fff047; display: inline-block; padding: 0 10px;">Means so much for me.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				That line made me smile. I feel loved. Very much loved.
				<br>
				Never won any heart, but I feel so much lovable.
				<br>
				Maybe I am not that bad after all.

			<p>
				I'd say it's all right. Time heals. Always do.
				<br>So should I take my chances on you?
			</p>
			<p>
				Then I realize. Time will also erase you from my head.
				<br>So why would I pick you up? Why would I even wanna try?
				<br>Knitting my scars with something so unpredictably pretty?
			</p>
			<p>
				Maybe I shouldn't take chances this time. I have no more heart to spend.

				Upstairs looks so much fit,

				I am happy for losing you,

				I am happy for repainting my walls with green, blue, and orange.
			</p>
			<p>
				No more purple,
				<br>
				this will be the nicest piece in my 25 years of beating heart.
				<br>
				I will win dots I never expected. Like sparks I tend to see in people.

			<p>
				Slide, I bumped into her.
				<br>
				What is the matter? I never asked for her.
				<br>
				When I think of home, I picture her laying on my bed gently brushing my head.
				<br>
				Kissing my lips softly.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thanks to you, I promise my self.

				Choose anyone over myself,

				I am over you at least.
				<br>
				I think.
				<br>
				I promise I won't expect, nor think.

			<p>
				Funny how I am back and forth and inside out about these three letters.
				<br>
				Is it still too funny for you that I was so crazy for you last year, the year before and the year before that?
				<br>
				One day before yesterday I still wondered if I could finally be good enough for anyone.
				<br>
				Not just anyone - I mean for you and you for me.

				I know you won't. I just hope you would.

				How would you handle it if I were you?

			<p>
				Spit me your thoughts.

				Hardcore idealist - I am like you.

				More than you, I would even say.

				Difference is, I'd done my reality check.

				You want someone like Portia,

				Learn this, someone like Ellen is the one who win her.

			<p>
				Let's travel together,
				<br>
				I will take you anywhere with me.
				<br>
				Anywhere.
				<br>
				So you can kiss me on the canal of Amsterdam.
				<br>
				And I can kiss you on top of that tall tower in Paris.
				<br>
				<br>
				I will grab the keys and boards,
				<br>
				We will surf together in Bali.
				<br>
				San Francisco is not too far,
				<br>
				Nowhere is too far when I am with you.

			<p>
				Take me anywhere you want to go.
				<br>
				Anywhere.
				<br>
				I don't care if that makes me a lunatic.
				<br>
				I've never felt so lost until I met you anyway.

			<p>
				Doesn't matter what they say,
				<br>
				You can get someone better than me.
				<br>
				I can get someone better than you.
				<br>
				I have been living my whole life tensely.
				<br>
				This time, this matter, I am letting go.
				<br>
				I trust you.
				<br>
				I trust you with my heart.

				Besides,

				I never thought I would say this line.

				How I never thought I would ever love anyone as much as I love you.

				Those days were painful.
