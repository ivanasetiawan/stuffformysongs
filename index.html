			<h1>Life.</h1>
			<p>
				Life's been awesome.
				<br>
				I am miraculously often slipped into the arms of unconditionally, unexplainable sweet stories.
				<br>
				People tend to pull me back in.
				<br>
				Sit back, relax. Breath in, out.
				<br>
			 	Several gestures of love.
				<br>
				A friend of a friend always tell me to chill.
				<br>
				Time returns, looping endlessly.
				<br>
				And that is ok - for I will always be kissing you in the morning.
			</p>

			<p>
				Stories keeping me interested.
				<br>
				Many slides of incidents shared on the empty box of words and the food tables.
				<br>
				Each of em ties me closer, undressing who you are.
				<br>
				And I like you more and more. Understanding you for who you are.
				<br>
				I often wish it would be more.
				<br>
				Can it ever be more?
			</p>

			<p>
				Life's been awesome.
				<br>
				It is so awesome, unexpectedly incredible that my brain can never comprehend.
				<br>
				Unfolding events, perfect matches. Unsmoked cigarettes.
				<br>
				It is been super duper awesome,
				<br>
				That I wouldn't mind if my heart stops beating anytime.
				<br>
				For what I live in is unexpectedly perfect.
				<br>
				Just please tell my mom, dad, &amp; sisters I love them, that I am happy.
				<br>
				Just in case I am taken by surprise.

			<h1>Line.</h1>
			<p>
				I'd say it's all right. Time heals. Always do.
				<br>So should I take my chances on you?
			</p>
			<p>
				Then I realize. Time will also erase you from my head.
				<br>So why would I pick you up? Why would I even wanna try?
				<br>Knitting my scars with something so unpredictably pretty?
			</p>
			<p>
				Maybe I shouldn't take chances this time. I have no more heart to spend.

			<h1>Fit.</h1>
			<p>
				Upstairs looks so much fit,
				<br>
				but I am happy where I am.
				<br>
				I am happy for losing you,
				<br>
				I am happy for repainting my walls with green, blue, and orange.
			</p>
			<p>
				No more purple,
				<br>
				this will be the nicest piece in my 25 years of beating heart.
				<br>
				I will win dots I never expected. Like sparks I tend to see in people.
			</p>
			<p>
				Slide, I bumped into her.
				<br>
				What is the matter? I never asked for her.
				<br>
				When I think of home, I picture her laying on my bed gently brushing my head.
				<br>
				Kissing my lips softly.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thanks to you, I promise my self.
				<br>
				To never ever, never ever,
				<br>
				Choose anyone over myself,
				<br>
				Ever again.

			<h1>Next summer.</h1>
			<p>
				Next summer might be fun.
				<br>
				I think.
				<br>
				I am over you at least.
				<br>
				I think.
				<br>
				I promise I won't expect, nor think.
			</p>

			<p>
				Funny how I am back and forth and inside out about these three letters.
				<br>
				Is it still too funny for you that I was so crazy for you last year, the year before and the year before that?
				<br>
				One day before yesterday I still wondered if I could finally be good enough for anyone.
				<br>
				Not just anyone - I mean for you and you for me.
				<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				Next summer might be fun.
				<br>
				I think. I am over you at least.
				<br>
				I think. I promise I won't expect, nor think.
			</p>
			<p>
				But I really hope it won't be you, like last time at Westerpark.
				<br>
				I was so unhappy. Just in case you're wondering.
				<br>
				I know you won't. I just hope you would.
				<br>
				I lost my self slowly getting to know you.

			<h1>Reality check.</h1>
			<p>
				Wake her up,
				<br>
				They suggested me to wake her up,
				<br>
				She needs a reality check.
				<br>
				Blow her with the truth.
				<br>
				How would you handle it if I were you?
			</p>

			<p>
				Spit me your thoughts.
				<br>
				Hardcore idealist - I am like you.
				<br>
				More than you, I would even say.
				<br>
				Difference is, I'd done my reality check.
				<br>
				And you have not, though you think you had.
			</p>

			<p>
				I have a good life you said,
				<br>
				Lady I washed my bleeding hands with people's shit.
				<br>
				Nothing comes easy for me.
				<br>
				Nothing comes easy for any of us.
				<br>
				So wake up, clock is ticking.
			</p>

			<p>
				You want someone like Portia,
				<br>
				Learn this, someone like Ellen is the one who win her.
				<br>
				Does this ring a bell to you?
				<br>
				Lady you need to get your reality check.

				My brain stops when I hear them mentioning your name.

				I am not usually like that.
				<br>
				Behaving like I am so in love with you.
			</p>

			<p>I am not.<br> Or am I?</p>

			<p>
				Denying what he said bout you.
				<br>
				Dirty eyes, making me feel so oh-in-a-rush.
				<br>
				I am ok like this.
				<br>
				But I dislike it when,
				<br>
				My brain stops whenever I hear them mentioning your name.

				Won't somebody please break my heart?

			<p>
				I miss saying that I would die if I see you with another.

				I miss the warmth of kissing your lips in the rain.

				I miss the butterfly in my belly.

				Above all, I miss seeing you.

				So hurry up, come here and steal me.

				They say,

				(be) Seventy-five, kid.
				<br>
				That's normal.
				<br>
				That's how things suppose to be.
				<br>
				A bit less. A bit more.
				<br>
				That's the beauty of balancing in life.

			<p>
				But I am one-hundred-and-ten.
				<br>
				Uneasily lovable.
				<br>
				Insanely awkward.
				<br>
				Unintentionally mean.
			</p>

			<p>
				But I am one-hundred-and-ten.
				<br>
				I am annoying as fuck.
				<br>
				Nothing nice in me that I can be sold for.
				<br>
				Sometimes I wonder how I make friends.
				<br>
				I feel less of a human at times.
			</p>

			<p>
				I wonder if anyone would ever gonna own me.
				<br>
				Ever.

			<h1>Vindicated love</h1>
			<p>
				Let's travel together,
				<br>
				I will take you anywhere with me.
				<br>
				Anywhere.
				<br>
				So you can kiss me on the canal of Amsterdam.
				<br>
				And I can kiss you on top of that tall tower in Paris.
				<br>
				<br>
				I will grab the keys and boards,
				<br>
				We will surf together in Bali.
				<br>
				San Francisco is not too far,
				<br>
				Nowhere is too far when I am with you.
			</p>

			<p>
				Take me anywhere you want to go.
				<br>
				Anywhere.
				<br>
				I don't care if that makes me a lunatic.
				<br>
				I've never felt so lost until I met you anyway.
			</p>

			<p>
				Doesn't matter what they say,
				<br>
				You can get someone better than me.
				<br>
				I can get someone better than you.
				<br>
				I have been living my whole life tensely.
				<br>
				This time, this matter, I am letting go.
				<br>
				I trust you.
				<br>
				I trust you with my heart.
			</p>

			<p>
				Besides,
				<br>
				I never thought I would say this line.
				<br>
				How I never thought I would ever love anyone as much as I love you.
			</p>

			<p>
				Those days were painful.
				<br>
				Shooing past lovers.
				<br>
				I learn from them enough.
				<br>
				Preparing me to finally recognize you.

				Once in a while,

				I fall.
				<br>
				So uncontrollably.
				<br>
				Like someone pulling me down into a deep limitless pool.
				<br>
				<br>
				Then I would feel like cutting my chest wide open.
				<br>
				And throw my heart out of the window.
				<br>
				I don't want to feel.
				<br>
				<br>
				I just don't want to feel.
				<br>
				Not like this.

			<p>
				Cynical.
				<br>
				You called me a cynical.

				Pathetically,

				For falling hard yet numb for you.
				<br>
				One eye once again.
				<br>
				Hypothetically speaking…
				<br>

			<p>
				Kissed you on your shoulder.
				<br>
				No lips.
				<br>
				On your neck.
				<br>
				No tongue.
				<br>
				On your nose.
				<br>
				Read my lips,
				<br>
				You could be my first.

			<p>
				Poke me again.
				<br>
				Stuff I regretted.
				<br>
				Words you regretted.
				<br>
				Trust you gained,
				<br>
				Trust you lost.
			</p>

			<p>
				I wanted you to beg me back.
				<br>
				I wanted you to rummage through your dead bed.
				<br>
				How did it feel? How broken was your heart?
				<br>
				Mine was pulverized.
			</p>

			<p>
				Still do not know what went wrong.
				<br>
				Still do not know what I did wrong.
				<br>
				My heart is exhausted.
				<br>
				Maybe everything is wrong with me.
			</p>

			<p>
				Oh.
				<br>
				Things were so beautiful when my blue toothbrush was in your bathroom.

			<h1>Note for a lady<span>[14-11-12]</span></h1>

			<p>
				Lady, no need to cry.
				<br>
				We make mistakes and that's how we learn.
				<br>
				To love yourself is the biggest gift you can give to yourself.
				<br>
				And that's why I am writing this to you.
			</p>

			<p>
				Look inside,
				<br>
				Sometimes you are so afraid of losing the game you haven't even started.
				<br>
				Understand that you need to stop punishing yourself and
				<br>
				let people care for you.
				<br>
				You have such a low self-confidence;
				<br>
				You do not feel that you deserve to be loved.
				<br>
				So you shut out everyone who you like or who likes you.
				<br>
				But why? why do you enjoy hurting yourself so much?
				<br>
				If you don't care about yourself enough now,
				<br>
				think twice and care for them instead.
				<br>
				I know it is easier for you to love them more than to love you.
			</p>

			<p>
				Lady, remember your last journey?
				<br>
				You crave so much for a spark,
				<br>
				yet throwing water when someone lights a fire.
				<br>
				<b>Chill. Relax a bit.</b>
				<br>
				Next time you're nervous, just take a deep fucking breath and smile.
				<br>
				Give them a chance. Write it down on your forehead.
				<br>
				And yes, when you do give the chance - some will spoil it,
				<br>
				and that's OK.
				<br>
				Learn from it and grow as a person with it.</p>

			<p>
				Lady, keep these in mind.
				<br>
				If she makes you smile in the morning.
				<br>
				If she makes you wanna dance whenever you see her glowing face.
				<br>
				If she makes you want to pause the time.
				<br>
				If she makes you feel so vulnerable.
				<br>
				If she makes your heart beat faster (even if it's for a split second).
				<br>
				If her pouting face makes you chuckle.
				<br>
				<b>Then she is worth it.</b>
				<br>
				And even if you ignore this list because she is not your type,
				<br>
				trust me: she is worth it.
				<br>
				Because we both know, she is the only one who is in your mind.
			</p>

			<p>
				Sincerely,
				<br>
				Yours <span class="icon-cloudy"></span>
			</p>
