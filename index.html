			<h1>Cynical<span>[OCT 2011]</span></h1>
			<p>
				Cynical.
				<br>
				You called me a cynical.
				<br>
				Pathetically,
				<br>
				For falling hard yet numb for you.
				<br>
				One eye once again.
				<br>
				Hypothetically speaking…
				<br>
				I let you punched me in the lungs.
			</p>	
			
			<p>
				Kissed you on your shoulder.
				<br>
				No lips.
				<br>
				On your neck.
				<br>
				No tongue.
				<br>
				On your nose.
				<br>
				Read my lips,
				<br>
				You could be my first.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Poke me again.
				<br>
				Stuff I regretted.
				<br>
				Words you regretted.
				<br>
				Trust you gained,
				<br>
				Trust you lost.
			</p>

			<p>
				I wanted you to beg me back.
				<br>
				I wanted you to rummage through your dead bed.
				<br>
				How did it feel? How broken was your heart?
				<br>
				Mine was pulverized.
			</p>

			<p>
				Still do not know what went wrong.
				<br>
				Still do not know what I did wrong.
				<br>
				My heart is exhausted.
				<br>
				Maybe everything is wrong with me.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Oh.
				<br>
				Things were so beautiful when my blue toothbrush was in your bathroom.

			<h1>Note for a lady<span>[14-11-12]</span></h1>

			<p>
				Lady, no need to cry.
				<br>
				We make mistakes and that's how we learn.
				<br>
				To love yourself is the biggest gift you can give to yourself.
				<br>
				And that's why I am writing this to you.
			</p>

			<p>
				Look inside,
				<br>
				Sometimes you are so afraid of losing the game you haven't even started.
				<br>
				Understand that you need to stop punishing yourself and
				<br>
				let people care for you.
				<br>
				You have such a low self-confidence;
				<br>
				You do not feel that you deserve to be loved.
				<br>
				So you shut out everyone who you like or who likes you.
				<br>
				But why? why do you enjoy hurting yourself so much?
				<br>
				If you don't care about yourself enough now,
				<br>
				think twice and care for them instead.
				<br>
				I know it is easier for you to love them more than to love you.
			</p>

			<p>
				Lady, remember your last journey?
				<br>
				You crave so much for a spark,
				<br>
				yet throwing water when someone lights a fire.
				<br>
				<b>Chill. Relax a bit.</b>
				<br>
				Next time you're nervous, just take a deep fucking breath and smile.
				<br>
				Give them a chance. Write it down on your forehead.
				<br>
				And yes, when you do give the chance - some will spoil it,
				<br>
				and that's OK.
				<br>
				Learn from it and grow as a person with it.</p>

			<p>
				Lady, keep these in mind.
				<br>
				If she makes you smile in the morning.
				<br>
				If she makes you wanna dance whenever you see her glowing face.
				<br>
				If she makes you want to pause the time.
				<br>
				If she makes you feel so vulnerable.
				<br>
				If she makes your heart beat faster (even if it's for a split second).
				<br>
				If her pouting face makes you chuckle.
				<br>
				<b>Then she is worth it.</b>
				<br>
				And even if you ignore this list because she is not your type,
				<br>
				trust me: she is worth it.
				<br>
				Because we both know, she is the only one who is in your mind.
			</p>

			<p>
				Sincerely,
				<br>
				Yours <span class="icon-cloudy"></span>
