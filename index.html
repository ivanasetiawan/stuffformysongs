				Excuses,
				<br>
				Getting good with those for twenty five years.
				<br>
				Master of pessimistic relationship.
				<br>
				I am selling the coin. I am going backwards.
				<br>
				Learning to love without expectations.
				<br>
				Won't somebody please break my heart?
			</p>
			<p>
				I miss saying that I would die if I see you with another.
				<br>
				I miss the warmth of kissing your lips in the rain.
				<br>
				I miss the butterfly in my belly.
				<br>
				Above all, I miss seeing you.
			</p>

			<p>
				So hurry up, come here and steal me.
				<br>
				I promise I will learn to love you without expectations.

			<p>
				They say,
				<br>
				(be) Seventy-five, kid.
				<br>
				That's normal.
				<br>
				That's how things suppose to be.
				<br>
				A bit less. A bit more.
				<br>
				That's the beauty of balancing in life.
			</p>

			<p>
				But I am one-hundred-and-ten.
				<br>
				Uneasily lovable.
				<br>
				Insanely awkward.
				<br>
				Unintentionally mean.
			</p>

			<p>
				But I am one-hundred-and-ten.
				<br>
				I am annoying as fuck.
				<br>
				Nothing nice in me that I can be sold for.
				<br>
				Sometimes I wonder how I make friends.
				<br>
				I feel less of a human at times.
			</p>

			<p>
				I wonder if anyone would ever gonna own me.
				<br>
				Ever.

			<h1>Vindicated love</h1>
			<p>
				Let's travel together,
				<br>
				I will take you anywhere with me.
				<br>
				Anywhere.
				<br>
				So you can kiss me on the canal of Amsterdam.
				<br>
				And I can kiss you on top of that tall tower in Paris.
				<br>
				<br>
				I will grab the keys and boards,
				<br>
				We will surf together in Bali.
				<br>
				San Francisco is not too far,
				<br>
				Nowhere is too far when I am with you.
			</p>

			<p>
				Take me anywhere you want to go.
				<br>
				Anywhere.
				<br>
				I don't care if that makes me a lunatic.
				<br>
				I've never felt so lost until I met you anyway.
			</p>

			<p>
				Doesn't matter what they say,
				<br>
				You can get someone better than me.
				<br>
				I can get someone better than you.
				<br>
				I have been living my whole life tensely.
				<br>
				This time, this matter, I am letting go.
				<br>
				I trust you.
				<br>
				I trust you with my heart.
			</p>

			<p>
				Besides,
				<br>
				I never thought I would say this line.
				<br>
				How I never thought I would ever love anyone as much as I love you.
			</p>

			<p>
				Those days were painful.
				<br>
				Shooing past lovers.
				<br>
				I learn from them enough.
				<br>
				Preparing me to finally recognize you.

			<p>
				Once in a while,
				<br>
				I fall.
				<br>
				So uncontrollably.
				<br>
				Like someone pulling me down into a deep limitless pool.
				<br>
				<br>
				Then I would feel like cutting my chest wide open.
				<br>
				And throw my heart out of the window.
				<br>
				I don't want to feel.
				<br>
				<br>
				I just don't want to feel.
				<br>
				Not like this.

			<h1>Cynical</h1>
			<p>
				Cynical.
				<br>
				You called me a cynical.
				<br>
				Pathetically,
				<br>
				For falling hard yet numb for you.
				<br>
				One eye once again.
				<br>
				Hypothetically speaking…
				<br>
				I let you punched me in the lungs.
			</p>

			<p>
				Kissed you on your shoulder.
				<br>
				No lips.
				<br>
				On your neck.
				<br>
				No tongue.
				<br>
				On your nose.
				<br>
				Read my lips,
				<br>
				You could be my first.
			</p>

			<p>
				Poke me again.
				<br>
				Stuff I regretted.
				<br>
				Words you regretted.
				<br>
				Trust you gained,
				<br>
				Trust you lost.
			</p>

			<p>
				I wanted you to beg me back.
				<br>
				I wanted you to rummage through your dead bed.
				<br>
				How did it feel? How broken was your heart?
				<br>
				Mine was pulverized.
			</p>

			<p>
				Still do not know what went wrong.
				<br>
				Still do not know what I did wrong.
				<br>
				My heart is exhausted.
				<br>
				Maybe everything is wrong with me.
			</p>

			<p>
				Oh.
				<br>
				Things were so beautiful when my blue toothbrush was in your bathroom.

			<h1>Note for a lady<span>[14-11-12]</span></h1>

			<p>
				Lady, no need to cry.
				<br>
				We make mistakes and that's how we learn.
				<br>
				To love yourself is the biggest gift you can give to yourself.
				<br>
				And that's why I am writing this to you.
			</p>

			<p>
				Look inside,
				<br>
				Sometimes you are so afraid of losing the game you haven't even started.
				<br>
				Understand that you need to stop punishing yourself and
				<br>
				let people care for you.
				<br>
				You have such a low self-confidence;
				<br>
				You do not feel that you deserve to be loved.
				<br>
				So you shut out everyone who you like or who likes you.
				<br>
				But why? why do you enjoy hurting yourself so much?
				<br>
				If you don't care about yourself enough now,
				<br>
				think twice and care for them instead.
				<br>
				I know it is easier for you to love them more than to love you.
			</p>

			<p>
				Lady, remember your last journey?
				<br>
				You crave so much for a spark,
				<br>
				yet throwing water when someone lights a fire.
				<br>
				<b>Chill. Relax a bit.</b>
				<br>
				Next time you're nervous, just take a deep fucking breath and smile.
				<br>
				Give them a chance. Write it down on your forehead.
				<br>
				And yes, when you do give the chance - some will spoil it,
				<br>
				and that's OK.
				<br>
				Learn from it and grow as a person with it.</p>

			<p>
				Lady, keep these in mind.
				<br>
				If she makes you smile in the morning.
				<br>
				If she makes you wanna dance whenever you see her glowing face.
				<br>
				If she makes you want to pause the time.
				<br>
				If she makes you feel so vulnerable.
				<br>
				If she makes your heart beat faster (even if it's for a split second).
				<br>
				If her pouting face makes you chuckle.
				<br>
				<b>Then she is worth it.</b>
				<br>
				And even if you ignore this list because she is not your type,
				<br>
				trust me: she is worth it.
				<br>
				Because we both know, she is the only one who is in your mind.
			</p>

			<p>
				Sincerely,
				<br>
				Yours <span class="icon-cloudy"></span>
			</p>
